          This is Nadim Mahmud Shuvo. I have completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in
          Physics. In my college and also in University life, I loved to spend
          time in coding. As, I also interested in Physics, that's why I
          admitted into Physics. Besides, I used to code in my spare time.
